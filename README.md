# Ombrello.io

Modified starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn)

## Up and running:

---

- Clone this repository
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
- Visit http://localhost:3000/

## Content editing

---

(All content is managed in the localization file.
(/src/feature/localization/config/localization.config.ts)
The usual localization method is applied to ensure consistency.
Because of this we need to be aware of null values in some cases. An empty string can sometimes be the solution.)

## Status of implementation

---

github repo (public!) => move to zure

## Road Map

---

tailwind css
container
panels w wrappers
typography elements => standalone components/own files

deploy with vercel
remove "localization"
